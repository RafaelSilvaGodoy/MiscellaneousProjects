# MiscellaneousProjects

# Summary
I created this repository to share some of the different projects that can be done through programing.

Each folder in this repository will contain a different project and may contain different programing languages.


## Linear-feedback shift register (LFSR)
> A script to **generate random numbers**.
>
>   This random number generator method consists in using an initial number as a seed
>and use an iterative equation that shifts and calculates XOR between the number digits.

## Pallet Load
> Pallet load is a NP-Complete problem that consists in place the maximum
>number of objects into a pallet.
>
> In this notebook the algorithm has some constraints. It was build to fit rectangular boxes
> into rectangular pallets. The boxes can only turn 90Â° per rotation.

## Gamma and Beta Functions
> The Gamma function is the function that represents the **factorial function**, used to calculate all numbers factorials, such as the famous

$\frac{1}{2}$! = $\Gamma$($\frac{3}{2}$) = $\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$ .

>
> The Beta function is a function close related to the Gamma function and it is used to represent scattering amplitude, used on string theory.
