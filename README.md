# MiscellaneousProjects

# Summary
I created this repository to share some of the different projects that can be done through programing.

Each folder in this repository will contain a different project and may contain different programing languages.


## Linear-feedback shift register (LFSR)
> A script to **generate random numbers**.
>
>   This random number generator method consists in using an initial number as a seed
>and use an iterative equation that shifts and calculates XOR between the number digits.

## Pallet Load
> Pallet load is a NP-Complete problem that consists in placing the maximum
>number of objects into a pallet.
>
> In this notebook the algorithm has some constraints. It was build to fit rectangular boxes
> into rectangular pallets. The boxes can only turn 90Â° per rotation.

## Gamma and Beta Functions
> The Gamma function is the function that represents the **factorial function**, used to calculate all numbers factorials, such as the famous:

> The Beta function is a function close related to the Gamma function and it is used to represent scattering amplitude on string theory.

## Ulam Spiral
> The Ulam spiral or prime spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers. It is constructed by    
>writing the positive integers in a square spiral and specially marking the prime numbers.
